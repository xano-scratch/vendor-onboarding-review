# Building your vendor-onboarding-review backend

The backend lives in [`index.ts`](index.ts) and is a single default-exported
`workspace()`. You grow it by registering typed objects.

## Learn the library from the library

Everything you need is in the package itself:

- `node_modules/@xanots/sdk/llms.txt` — the router: the mental model, the deploy contract, every gotcha, and control flow. Read it in full first; it ends with a list of topic files and the condition for opening each.
- `node_modules/@xanots/sdk/llms/*.md` — one file per surface. Open the one or two whose condition matches the task; skip the rest.
- The published TypeScript types and JSDoc (`node_modules/@xanots/sdk/**/*.d.ts`).
- `node_modules/@xanots/sdk/manifest.json` — the exhaustive reference; grep or `jq` the one entry you need rather than reading it whole.

Author against those signatures — don't invent an API that isn't there.

## The shape

```
xano/
├── index.ts          default export: the workspace registering everything below
├── tables/<name>.ts  a table (name, typed schema, indexes)
├── api/<group>.ts    an API group; pin its canonical slug so paths are stable
└── api/<endpoint>.ts a query: name, verb, apiGroup, typed input, a stack, a response
```

## Steps

1. **Define a table** under `tables/` with `table({ name, schema: { ... } })`.
   `id` and `created_at` are auto-injected.
2. **Define an API group** with `apiGroup({ name, canonical })`. Pinning the
   canonical slug keeps the public path stable and lets `getPath()` resolve in
   the browser bundle without a lock file.
3. **Define endpoints** with `query({ name, verb, apiGroup, input, ... })`, building
   the logic from the `s.*` statement helpers and the expression/column/input/
   reference helpers.
4. **Register everything** in `index.ts`:
   ```ts
   export default workspace("vendor-onboarding-review")
     .registerTables([...])
     .registerApiGroups([...])
     .registerQueries([...]);
   ```
5. **Assert it works** — add a `tests: [...]` entry to a query or function
   (named inputs plus `expect.*` assertions on its response), or a
   `workflowTest({ name, stack })` when the behavior spans several objects.
   They live beside the code they cover and ship with it. See "Testing" below.
6. **Compile** with `npm run xano:export`, and **deploy** with
   `npm run xano:deploy` (after `xanots login`). The first of either writes
   `xano/xano.lock` — **commit it**. It pins every object's identity, so a later
   rename renames the object instead of deleting and recreating it. See
   "`xano.lock` — commit it" in the project README.

## Testing

Two kinds of test are authored in `xano/` alongside the objects they cover, and
both run against a DEPLOYED environment:

- **Unit test** — `tests: [...]` on a `query`, `defineFunction`, or
  `middleware`. Each entry is a named set of inputs run against that object, with
  `expect.*` assertions on its response. A statement's `mock` (keyed by test
  NAME) makes one step return a value instead of doing its work, but only while
  that test runs.
- **Workflow test** — `workflowTest({ name, stack })`, a standalone object whose
  stack calls others (`s.function.call`, `s.api.call`) and asserts with
  `s.expect.*`. Use it for behavior that spans objects.

`expect.*` and `s.expect.*` are different builders — an assertion record versus
a workflow-test statement — and are not interchangeable.

```bash
npm run xano:deploy    # tests run against what is deployed, so deploy first
npm run xano:test      # runs both kinds; exits 5 if any fail
```

`npx xanots deploy ./xano/index.ts --test` does both in one step, and
`npx xanots test list` shows what a deployed environment carries without running
anything. Read `node_modules/@xanots/sdk/llms/tests.md` before authoring either
kind.

### Event-driven objects

A scheduled `task`, an `mcpServer`, and every trigger **fire normally on an
ephemeral** — where `deploy` sends them — so test them by deploying and letting
them run.

## Wire the frontend

In [`../frontend/src/lib/api.ts`](../frontend/src/lib/api.ts), derive paths and
types from your query defs (`getPath()`, `InferInput`, `InferResponse`) — never
hand-type a URL or a request body.

Keep the client bundle lean (**split route metadata from stack-heavy authoring**):

- `import type` for shapes — `InferInput`/`InferResponse` erase to nothing.
- Import the **one lean query def** for its `getPath()`/`verb`, never `xano/index.ts`
  (that pulls the whole workspace). A def's `s.*`/`c.*` stack calls run at module
  load to build it, so they can't be tree-shaken out of the bundle.
- A def whose stack builds a heavy graph — an agent + its tools via `s.ai.agent.run`
  — drags that whole graph in. For those, don't import the def in the browser:
  declare its `{ path, verb }` as plain metadata (see the `ROUTES` example in
  `api.ts`) and verify it against the compiled bundle with
  `npx xanots routes xano/index.ts`.
